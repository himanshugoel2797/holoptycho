"""Fourier-shift sub-pixel patch placement for ViT mosaic stitching.

Algorithm adapted from the ptycho-vit reference implementation
(``utils/ptychi_utils.py:place_patches_fourier_shift`` on the holostitching
branch: https://github.com/SYNAPS-I/ptycho-vit), in turn adapted from Ming
Du's pty-chi (https://github.com/AdvancedPhotonSource/pty-chi). The trained
ViT outputs are reassembled this way at evaluation time
(``run_inference.py``); doing anything different recon-side produces an
image inconsistent with what the network was supervised against.

Implemented in numpy (not torch) — ``vit_inference.py`` deliberately avoids
torch to stay container-light. The algorithm is just FFT + scatter-add +
divide, no autograd needed.

Performance notes:
* The FFT path uses ``scipy.fft.fft2`` / ``ifft2`` with
  ``workers=-1`` (multithreaded pocketfft), running in ``complex64``.
  ~25-50x faster than ``numpy.fft`` on a (64, 128, 128) batch, with no
  observable accuracy loss after the over-extract+crop.
* The phase ramp is built as the outer product of the per-axis 1D
  ramps (``ramp_y[:, :, None] * ramp_x[:, None, :]``) instead of one
  ``np.exp`` over the full (N, H, W) volume. ~15x cheaper.
* The counts canvas is updated by a dedicated scatter-add (no FFT). A
  Fourier shift of an all-ones patch returns ones (only DC is non-zero,
  and DC is unchanged by the phase ramp), so the FFT round-trip the
  reference does on ``np.ones_like(patches)`` is pure waste. Skipping it
  eliminates the second half of the per-batch stitch work.
