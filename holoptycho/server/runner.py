"""Runs the Holoscan application (PtychoApp) in a subprocess and keeps
AppState in sync with its lifecycle.

Why subprocess (not a thread or asyncio task in the API process)?

Holoscan's GXF runtime, CUDA contexts, TensorRT engines, and CuPy memory
pools don't fully release between back-to-back ``Application`` instances in
the same Python process — confirmed by the Holoscan docs and by empirical
testing (``cudaErrorIllegalAddress`` on the second ``run_async``). The SDK
expects one application per process. Spawning a fresh subprocess per
``/run`` gives us a guaranteed-clean CUDA context every time, and lets
``/stop`` use OS signals (SIGUSR1 for graceful, SIGTERM/SIGKILL as escalation)
which the OS guarantees to deliver — no SDK cooperation needed.

Stop semantics (three-stage):

1. SIGUSR1 — child sets ``_finish_event``, ``PtychoRecon.compute()`` trips
   the iteration-cap branch on its next tick, ``SaveResult`` writes
   ``final/`` to Tiled, ``fragment.stop_execution()`` releases the run loop,
   the subprocess exits 0 cleanly. Preserves ``write_final``.
2. SIGTERM — fallback if soft signal didn't drain within the grace window.
3. SIGKILL — last resort if the subprocess is wedged in C++ code.
