        chunking immediately; chunks are populated lazily by
        ``write_diffraction_chunk`` as frames arrive. The register-then-write-
        blocks split is essential — the alternative
        ``write_array(np.zeros(...))`` path would upload the whole zero buffer
        up front, which times out over WAN.

        ``stride`` controls the row-to-scan-frame mapping: row ``r`` of dp
        holds scan frame ``r * stride``. ``n_keep`` is the count of kept
        frames (= ``(nz - 1) // stride + 1``). For ``stride=1`` (default) the
        buffer is dense, ``n_keep == nz``, and behaviour matches the original
        write-every-frame semantics. The stride is stamped into run metadata
        as ``dp_stride`` so consumers can recover the mapping.

        ``dp`` stores **amplitude** (= ``sqrt(intensity)``, rounded to uint8)
        rather than raw uint16 intensity. The Eiger detector is 16-bit but
        ``sqrt(65535) ≈ 256``, so the full intensity range maps cleanly into
        uint8 — and the 1-count quantization that introduces is well below
        the Poisson noise floor for any pixel with non-trivial counts. This
        halves the on-the-wire write volume vs uint16 (640 MB → 320 MB for
        a 10K frame 256×256 scan) since Tiled's ``write_block`` does not
        accept compressed payloads. ptycho-vit's Tiled-backed loader expects
        this amplitude form and skips its own sqrt step on this data path.
